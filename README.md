# Currency Converter App

This is a simple React application that allows users to convert currency values from one currency to another. It utilizes React hooks and components for managing state and user interface elements.

## Features

- Currency Conversion: Users can enter an amount, select the source currency (From), and the target currency (To). The application then displays the converted amount based on the current exchange rate.

- Swap Currencies: Users can easily swap the source and target currencies by clicking the "swap" button. This also swaps the entered amounts.

- Input Validation: The application validates that the entered amount is a valid positive number before performing the conversion. If the entered amount is invalid, an alert is displayed.

## How to Use

1. Enter Amount: Input the amount you want to convert in the From section.

2. Select Source Currency: Choose the source currency from the dropdown list in the From section.

3. Select Target Currency: Choose the target currency from the dropdown list in the To section.

4. Swap Currencies (Optional): Click the "swap" button to interchange the source and target currencies along with their corresponding amounts.

5. Convert: Click the "Convert" button to calculate and display the converted amount in the To section.
